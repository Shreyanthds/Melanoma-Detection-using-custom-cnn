# Melanoma Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Problem Statement
The task is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model capable of accurately detecting melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be fatal if not detected early, accounting for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to significantly reduce the manual effort required for diagnosis.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The images are categorized into various diseases, including:

Actinic keratosis

Basal cell carcinoma

Dermatofibroma

Melanoma

Nevus

Pigmented benign keratosis

Seborrheic keratosis

Squamous cell carcinoma

Vascular lesion

The dataset has been sorted according to the classifications provided by ISIC, with melanomas and moles having slightly more dominant images
compared to other diseases.

### Conclusion

The congruence between training and validation accuracy suggests a well-fitted model.
The balance between training and validation loss indicates a well-fitted model.
An encouraging validation accuracy of 0.87 underscores the model's proficiency in classifying images with an 87% success rate.
